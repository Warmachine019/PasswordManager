# PasswordManager
A GUI based Password manager to keep all your passwords stored on a text file locally in your device.
Random passwords can be generated by clicking on "generate password".
This randomly generated password is copied to your clipboard too in order to paste in webistes.
An error message pops up if the user leaves any of the fields empty and a confirmation message with all the details is shown before finally entering the data into a text file.
The email, website, and password are stored locally on your device within a text file.

Update:
Added error handling concepts to make the program more stable.
Program now stores data in a JSON file instead of a .txt file to make data more readable by the user and can also be easily accessed by the computer.
Integrated a function to search for webites in the JSON file and display the linked email address and passwords.
